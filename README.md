# Node-LIRI
In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Use commands:
spotify-this-song "Song Title or Artist";
movie-this "movie Title";
do-what-it-says;
